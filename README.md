# FumoFetch
fumofetch is another generic linux fetch program that just so happens to have a fumo for it's logo.

# Why does this exist?
Honestly i just wanted to write my own fetch program for fun.

# Other fumos/images
To change the image just edit logo.txt<br>
Any kind of ascii art will work just fine.<br>
You can also use `catimg` if you want something fancier.<br>
Also feel free to make a commit with your favorite fumo!<br>
